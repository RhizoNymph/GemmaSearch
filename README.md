# GemmaSearch

This is a basic implementation of function calling intended for use with Gemma3-27b-it with:

- DuckDuckGo search
- Arxiv search
- Playwright based web page fetch
- PDF text parsing on fetch

Todo:
- Add web search options that aren't DuckDuckGo (has rate limit issues)
- Add RAG setup and context management for long documents/long running sessions
- Add support for other models
